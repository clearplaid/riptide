title: "About"
description: "Rising Tide Games is the belief that life can be better if we look out for each other. It is the belief that work should not be soul crushing or a necessary evil for survival. It is reason met with compassion and acceptance. It is the fair distribution of profits to the people producing the value. It is a desire to lift all the boats around us. We are a company that exists to improve the lives of the people that work and interact with us. We just happen to make games as a way to pursue that endeavour."
